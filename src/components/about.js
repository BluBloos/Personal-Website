          Programming has been a large part of my life since early in high school. I wanted to play a video game,
          but my parents would have it that it was too innapropriate to play. So I set out to program the game myself.
          Long story short, my version of the game never saw the light of day, but I was hooked on programming ever since.
          I've built up a sizable library of projects since then, most of which I've made available on this website.

          At school, I've found interest in multiple design teams, most notably QMIND and Queen's Space Engineering Team.
          These teams have been incredible, and I'm learning things at a rapid rate. I'm overwhemlingy excited to see where
          they take me.

          Outside of school (and tech), I enjoy ‚õ∞Ô∏è climbing, üèÉ running, and spending time with friends.
