          Programming has been a large part of my life since early in high school. I stumbled into video game development,
          and I was hooked ever since. I've built up a sizable library of projects since then, most of which I've made available on this website.

        <p>
          At school, I've found interest in <a href="https://qmind.ca/" target="_blank">QMIND </a>
           and <a href="qset.ca" target="_blank">Queen's Space Engineering Team</a> (QSET). With these teams I've had the
           opportunity to expand my portfolio of skills with technologies such as Tensorflow and ROS.

          Outside of school (and tech), I enjoy ‚õ∞Ô∏è climbing, üèÉ running, and spending time with friends.
